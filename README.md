# **Solemn AI Governance Suite**
The Solemn AI suite revolutionizes AI governance by integrating organizational and private data, best practices, regulatory compliance, and ethical considerations into a comprehensive tool tailored for high-risk AI systems. Our platform empowers decision-makers to embed crucial governance components, ensuring social acceptability and risk mitigation throughout the AI lifecycle. Leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based RAG system, Solemn AI enhances data retrieval and analysis, providing precise, actionable and relevant insights. This makes Solemn AI indispensable for any organization aiming to implement responsible AI practices effectively and comply with global standards like the OECD and EU AI Act. 

## **Inspiration**: 
The need for robust AI governance in high-risk systems, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, global standards and ethical practices inspired the creation of the Solemn AI Suite.

## **What it does**: 
The suite enhances AI governance by integrating regulatory compliance and ethical considerations, providing tools for effective decision-making and risk management in AI system development and operations. Our suite delivers a comprehensive risk analysis tailored to user inputs, covering security, privacy, and governance at a regulatory level. With its conversational interface, Solemn AI Suite leverages user inputs and integrated enterprise-specific data to recommend key stakeholders to engage and pertinent regulatory or structural issues to consider throughout the AI development and deployment cycle. Designed to streamline enterprise-level AI governance, it provides essential guidance, a detailed checklist, and critical considerations to help organizations devise the most effective AI strategies tailored to their needs. Graph RAG suite enhances AI applications by integrating more domain-specific context for better relevance and inference. It boosts explainability through human-readable relationships within data. Accelerate the development of generative AI applications with robust tooling and seamless integration capabilities. It allows for the combination of multiple tools and patterns to create intelligent GenAI applications. It utilizes corrective semantic layers to improve data retrieval, leveraging graph patterns and embeddings that incorporate both structured and unstructured data.

## **How we built it**: 
We’ve started processing the EU AI Act, by chunking the text, and creating embeddings using the Hugging Face library. After processing the construction of KG in Neo4J database we stored embeddings in a Chroma vector store for efficient retrieval. At the center of our system lies the Gemini 1.5 Pro (or Google Generative AI) language model, which generates high-quality answers based on the relevant context retrieved from the vector store. Finally, the user interface is built in the Streamlit, offers a clear experience for users to ask their questions and receive responses. Our Knoweldge Graph based RAG enhances the retrieval capabilities of LLMs for analyzing private and public data, addressing the challenges of connecting disparate information across documents. This process ensures a customized approach to AI governance and regulatory compliance.

## **Challenges we ran into**: 
One of the main challenges was synthesizing complex regulatory information into actionable insights and ensuring the system aligned with diverse global standards.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**: 
We're proud of creating a comprehensive tool that simplifies AI governance and fosters responsible AI development across different industries. Our suite is designed to address various incidents and questions that business and system owners encounter in their daily operations. It aids users in regulatory canvassing, compliance monitoring, and managing risks and constraints, thereby enriching the overall AI governance knowledge base. This expert system also performs semantic searches and completions, leveraging enterprise-specific data and regulatory requirements to provide targeted solutions.

## **What we learned**: 
We learned the importance of detailed origin in AI systems and the value of a structured approach to data to drive compliance and ethical AI practices.

## **What's next for Solemn AI Governance Suite**: 
Next, we plan to enhance the suite's capabilities by incorporating more advanced analytics and expanding its applicability across various jurisdictions and industries. We aim to broaden the suite’s focus to address critical issues such as red teaming, real-time augmented assistance, testing, automated solutions. Our goal is to promote the responsible use of AI, ensuring that AI systems are both trustworthy and reliable.
